# Seattle-ops-102d10 Read: Class 01
## Why does this topic matter?
#### This topic matters because the first half of ops 102 revolves around the hardware components of computers, for example, lessons 1 and 2 allows us hands-on experience with the inner workings of a desktop tower. With this reading assignment, in my opinion, knowing how certain hardware components were hacked and its impact on stakeholders (i.e government agencies and corporations) is a good case study for individuals who are going into the cybersecurity career field.

## What is a computer?
### Reading, Research, and Discussion
#### 1. How is a hardware hack different from a software hack?
#### - Hardware hacks are more difficult to pull off and potentially more devastating. At a minimum hardware hacks could cause long-term disruptions to a company's confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA triad) procedures.
#### 2. What are the two ways for spies to alter a computer’s hardware?
#### - The two ways a spy can alter a computer’s hardware is interdiction and seeding changes from the beginning. Interdiction occurs when devices are manipulated as they are in transit from a manufacturer to customer. Seeding is accomplished by developing a deep understanding of a product's design, manipulating components at the factory, and ensuring that the doctored devices made it through the global logistics chain to the desired location.
#### 3. Explain how the hack worked.
#### - The chips had been inserted during the manufacturing process, enabling access to high-value corporate secrets and sensitive government networks.
#### 4. How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source?
#### - The FBI received reports from Apple and Amazon concerning hardware issues. The item in question is a signal conditioning coupler, undetectable without specialized equipment. This type of hardware manipulation creates a real-world trail; government agencies began to follow Supermicro’s supply chain in reverse through shipping manifests and invoices in order to get to the source. The source was traced to four subcontracting factories who had suborned the factory managers to manipulate the design. The investigators concluded that it was the work of the People’s Liberation Army unit specializing in hardware attacks.
## Things I want to know more about.
#### I would like to know more about the auditing procedures for both hardware and software hacks. I understand that when the government is involved in investigations, some information cannot be disclosed, but I am curious about the methodologies and frameworks that were used to identify the hacks. It would be great if the article gave the audience more insight into tools that were used to isolate the device that compromised these motherboards.
