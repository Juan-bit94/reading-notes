# Readings: Network Connectivity
# Wht does this topic matter?
- This topic matters beacuse as a sybersecurity professional it is important to know about protocols that allow use to connect remotely and secure that connection.
- 
# What is the Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol?
- The SSH protocol is a method for secure remote login from one computer to another. It protects communications security and integrity with strong encryption.  
# What are the typical uses of the SSH protocol?
- The SSH protocol is used in a variety of scenarios such as:
  1. Providing secure access for users and automated processes.
  2. Interactive and automated file transfers.
  3. Issuing remote commands
  4. Managing network infrastructure and other mission-critical system components.
# How does the SSH protocol work?
- The protocol works in a client-server model, which means that the connection is established by the SSH client (user computer) connecting to the SSH server (centralized server).
- The SSH client drives the connection setup process and uses public key cryptography to verify the identity of the SSH server.
# How is the data kept safe when transmitted between the SSH client and server?
- SSH protocol uses strong symmetric encryption (PKI) and hashing algorithms to ensure the privacy and integrity of the data that is exchanged between the client and server.
# What is SFTP?
- The SFTP stands for the SSH file Transfer Protocol, it is the most widely used secure file transfer protocol today. It runs over SSH.
# What is RDP? And how to use it
- RDP stands for Remote Desktop Protocol, its port number is 3389 and it is a Microsoft owned tool that gives users the ability to connect to a remote windows P or server over the internet or local network.
# What is Windows Remote Desktop Connection?
- It is a tool that gives users the ability to connect to a remote windows PC or server over the internet or on a local network.
# What is RDP?
- The Remote Desktop Protocol allows remote users to see and use Windows on a device in another location. Key peripherals like your keyboard and mouse are shared with the remote machine, allowing users to use and control it from any location.
# What is the RDP port number?
- The RDP port number is 3389
