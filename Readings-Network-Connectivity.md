# Readings: Network Connectivity
# Why does this topic matter?
- This topic matters because as a cybersecurity professional it is important to know about protocols that allow use to connect remotely and secure that connection.
- In this day in age, there is a real security need for data encryption in transit and at rest. Knowing about SSH will enable individuals to understand concepts such as encryption, tunneling, and other security protocols. 
# What is the Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol?
- The SSH protocol is a method for secure remote login from one computer to another. It protects communications security and integrity with strong encryption.  
# What are the typical uses of the SSH protocol?
- The SSH protocol is used in a variety of scenarios such as:
  1. Providing secure access for users and automated processes.
  2. Interactive and automated file transfers.
  3. Issuing remote commands
  4. Managing network infrastructure and other mission-critical system components.
# How does the SSH protocol work?
- The protocol works in a client-server model, which means that the connection is established by the SSH client (user computer) connecting to the SSH server (centralized server).
- The SSH client drives the connection setup process and uses public key cryptography to verify the identity of the SSH server.
# How is the data kept safe when transmitted between the SSH client and server?
- SSH protocol uses strong symmetric encryption (PKI) and hashing algorithms to ensure the privacy and integrity of the data that is exchanged between the client and server.
# What is SFTP?
- The SFTP stands for the SSH file Transfer Protocol, it is the most widely used secure file transfer protocol today. It runs over SSH.
# What is RDP? And how to use it
- RDP stands for Remote Desktop Protocol, its port number is 3389 and it is a Microsoft owned tool that gives users the ability to connect to a remote windows P or server over the internet or local network.
# What is Windows Remote Desktop Connection?
- It is a tool that gives users the ability to connect to a remote windows PC or server over the internet or on a local network.
# What is RDP?
- The Remote Desktop Protocol allows remote users to see and use Windows on a device in another location. Key peripherals like your keyboard and mouse are shared with the remote machine, allowing users to use and control it from any location.
# What is the RDP port number?
- The RDP port number is 3389
# Things I want to know more about
- I would like to know about encryption protocols that are not in use anymore. Knowing why they are not used would give me an idea of how hacks happen due to misconfigurations in the security settings.
