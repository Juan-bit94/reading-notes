# Readings: Command Line Interface
# Why this topic matters?
- This topic matters because the command line is a utility used in cybersecurity and IT in general. Knowing how to use and navigate on the command line will speed up task completion compared to using a GUI. Additionally, It's a good introduction to the idea of coding since command lines can execute bash and other code on the interface.
