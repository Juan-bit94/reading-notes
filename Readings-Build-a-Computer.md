# Readings: Build a Computer
## How does this topic matter as it relates to what I am studying
#### - This topic matters because it gives me a look into the individual components that make up a computer. The modules and labs allow me to understand the function of the individual components of a pc such as how data is stored, where the power supply unit is located, and how CPUs actually work. 
#### - In the long run, this topic matters because knowing how to build a computer is fundamental to understanding other topics that we will build up to through the ops and cybersecurity course.  
### 1. Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need?
#### - The answer to this question depends on how you want to use a pc, knowing what type of computer you want to work with is a critical part.
#### - CPU cores are individual processing units that receive instructions from a single computing task. The core then processes the information and temporarily stores it in the Random Access Memory (RAM).
#### - Clock speeds determine how quickly the CPU can retrieve and interpret instructions. Certain multi-core processors were developed with higher clock speeds in mind.
#### - Since both processor cores and clock speeds are essential to operating a computer, the answer to which is better: more cores or higher speed depends on what the need is.
#### - You can have a high clock speed with a few cores that would make it so your computer loads and interacts with a single application quickly.
#### - alternatively, you could have more processor cores, but with a slower clock speed which would cause your pc to work with more applications at a given time, but they run a bit slower.
#### - It all depends on the needs of the individual. For a pc that is needed for basic use, a dual-core processor will be fine, but for a high performance pc then consider a 4 or 8 core processor. If you find yourself in need of a video editing or gaming pc, then it is recommended you get a high clock speed processor such as a 4 GHz one.
### 2. What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?
#### - The details you should look for when finding a motherboard which fits a chosen processor is compatibility.
#### - To ensure compatibility you must check three things: the CPU's socket, the motherboard chipset, and BIOS compatibility.
#### - CPU brands manufacture a variety of different CPUs with different sockets, meaning you will need to find brand compatible motherboards for the specific CPU brand. Additionally, you need to make sure you have the correct socket for the particular CPU.
#### - it is best practice to find the manufacturer and model of your motherboard to determine which CPUs are compatible with it. Once you have that information, its easy to search for the specifications for that motherboard and what processors will be a fit for the motherboard, along with chipsets and BIOS compatibility. There is no other way around it in the end, the motherboard and the CPU have to be compatible.
### 3. What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?
#### - The tradeoffs that need to be evaluated while selecting a storage device comes down to price and speed.
#### - Faster memory such as solid state drives (SSD) comes with higher cost compared with slower memory speeds found in hard disk drives (HDD).
#### - In recent times there has been a third option introduced, the hybrid hard drives (SSHDs). This contains both components for classic magnetic hard drives and the small solid state drives. This storage option allows for quick loads of the operating system and applications, while the hard disk drive partitions serve as a storage room for stationary files such as video, picture, and movie files.
#### - In the end, if price is not an issue I would recommend SSD for storage since the tradeoff in price would be faster speed. If you are on a budget then a hard disk drive would meet the requirement in terms of affordable storage that is reliable but lacks a bit of speed. The happy medium has been recently introduced as the SSHD, which provides a decent bang for your buck in terms of storage amount, cost, and speed.
### 4. Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?
#### - I would explain to people the key parts of a computer by comparing it with the human body.
#### - In a way that I think people would best connect with, I would say that the CPU acts like the brain since it processes information and some individuals process things one at a time more quickly than others, while some can multitask given enough time.
#### - Next I would explain how the motherboard serves as the nervous system, connecting the components of our body to the brain (CPU).
#### - Following that I would say that RAM is our human memory, things that we remember because it's important, but as soon as we are done with it we forget some or most of it.
#### - Lastly, I would explain how the cardiovascular system is a power supply unit, since we have to pump and circulate blood within our body to move all parts.
#### - All in all, while it may sound a bit unusual, I believe that people will get the idea of how key parts of a computer work if I relate them to our human bodies.
### Things I want to learn more about
#### - I would like to learn about how you can modify certain components of a pc such as the CPU. I heard of a term called overclocking, I would be interested to learn about this and other ways of increasing the use of pc components.
